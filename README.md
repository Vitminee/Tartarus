# **Tartarus**
A Minecraft Terra generation pack that adds a ton of new biomes to the Nether!

Tartarus is a Terra world generation pack for Minecraft Java v1.19 that adds 12 custom biomes to the Nether! This includes vanilla biomes, however these biomes have been reworked to fit the scheme of this pack better. 

## Structure Generation
Nether Fortresses and Bastion Remnants just like vanilla.

## Ore Generation
Nether Gold, Quartz, and Ancient Debris generate to resemble vanilla nether ore generation as best as possible.

## Credits
Tartarus was made possible only through the help and support from the PolyhedralDev team, as well as the default Overworld config packaged with Terra, which some edited configs can be found in various assets in Tartarus. You can check out the pack here: https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/TerraOverworldConfig

## Biome List
A list of screenshots and descriptions of all the biomes included in this pack can be found on the Wiki of this repository.

## Installation
Download the Tartarus pack from the [releases page](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Tartarus/releases) for a reliable pack version
or from the main Tartarus branch for changes that haven't been applied to the latest release yet.

Follow this [installation guide](https://terra.polydev.org/install/index.html) for your particular platform.

Fabric users will have to edit the `level.dat` in order to apply custom generation to the end dimension.
